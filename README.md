# VHDL
VHDL stands for **V**HSIC **H**ardware **D**escription **L**anguage.

VHSIC stands for **V**ery **H**igh **S**peed **I**ntegrated **C**ircuits.

VHDL is a programming language used for describing the behavior and structure of electronic systems. VHDL is widely used in the design, simulation, and verification of digital circuits, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

# WHY VHDL?
VHDL has the following advantages:-

+ It is industry standard and is IEEE Standard Language.
+ It is platform/vendor independent.
+It can be used to design and simulate digital circuits.
+ It supports hierarchical design
+ It is case insensitive
+ It is a concurrent language i.e. all lines of code execute at the same time. However, it also supports sequential statements.
+ Quick turn around time to market.

# How to write code in VHDL?

VHDL supports the follwing coding conventions:-
+ DATAFLOW STYLE:- Here, the code is written in a concurrent style where data flows from input to output after performing the necessary logical operations between input and output.
+ BEHAVIORAL STYLE:- Here, the code is written in hierarchical manner under processed statements and it describes the behaviour of the circuit with respect to it's truth table.
+ STRUCTURAL STYLE:- The code is written in hierarchical manner and different components of the circuit are described at first then they are reconnected to form the original larger circuit.
+ MIXED STYLE:- It is a combination of the above three styles.
